<h3 id="creating-products">Creating products</h3>

<p>To create a product, we need to understand three things:</p>

<h4 id="desirability">Desirability</h4>

<p><strong>Do people want or need this?</strong> Find this out by getting out of the building and asking them. Activities could include user testing, surveys, analytics, in-depth interviews and diary studies.</p>

<h4 id="feasibility">Feasibility</h4>

<p><strong>Can it be built?</strong> Talk with developers to find out.</p>

<h4 id="viability">Viability</h4>

<p><strong>Does it fulfill a business need?</strong> Talk with businesspeople who have a stake in the work.</p>

<p>If we only focus on a solution or features, we may miss other possibility‚Äôs which are much stronger. Therefore we need to gather data from all areas before we start to decided upon the best direction.</p>

<h3 id="features-arms-race">Features arms race</h3>

<p>Design for user goals, not what we can build. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apple TV remote vs. any DVD/VHS remote.</li>
  <li>Google Docs vs. Microsoft Word.</li>
</ul>

<p>Discovery happens at the beginning of the design process. Our aim is to take the problem and explore it fully.</p>
